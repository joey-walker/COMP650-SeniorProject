=== Git instructions for fetching, merging, and pushing work

All development to the command line will be done on the senior-dev branch.  I (Joey) will do development joey-dev branch,
so please do not delete the branch after pull requests.

These are the available remotes:

----

Also available by typing `git remote -v`

Adding the upstream remote:

git remote add upstream https://github.com/git/git.git

*Fetching and merging:*

At the start of doing any form of work, first grab commits from the official git repository:

1. `git fetch upstream`

2. `git merge upstream/master`

Then grab commits from our central git repository for this group's commits.

1. `git fetch origin`

2. `git merge origin/master`

Switch to the senior-dev branch 

git checkout senior-dev

Fix any merge conflicts from here on before continuing to do work.

*Adding, committing, pushing*

1. `git add .` (or specific files/directories instead of .)

2. `git commit -m "message here"`

Push by doing the following

1. `git push your-name-here` find your name in the remotes (i.e mentu would do `git push mentu`)

If you cloned from git the repository.  I recommend switching the default view on Github to the senior-dev branch.

*Pull Requests*

1.  To submit work, do a pull request at https://github.com/joey-walker/git .  Go to pull requests and confirm merge, or wait till someone merges it in for you.
